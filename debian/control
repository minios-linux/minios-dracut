Description: MiniOS dracut modules for initramfs generation
 This package provides dracut modules and tools for building
 MiniOS-compatible initramfs images using dracut.
 .
 It includes:
  * mkdracut - script to build MiniOS initramfs with dracut
  * 90minios - main MiniOS dracut module
  * 99minios-cleanup - cleanup dracut module
  * 90-minios.conf - configuration file for MiniOS
 .
 This package is required for rebuilding initramfs in installed
 MiniOS systems that use dracut as the initramfs builder.
 .
 The mkdracut script is essential because it provides the --add-drivers
 option which explicitly includes filesystem drivers (squashfs, overlay,
 loop, zram, ext4, vfat, ntfs3, exfat) that are omitted by the minimal
 dracut configuration to keep initramfs size small.
